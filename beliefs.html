            <p class="lead">We believe in one <span class="gold">God</span>, Creator of all things, holy, infinitely perfect, and eternally existing in a loving unity of three equally divine Persons: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p class="lead">We believe that <span class="gold">God</span> has spoken in the Scriptures, both Old and New Testaments, through the words of human authors. As the verbally inspired Word of God, the Bible is without error in the original writings, the complete revelation of His will for salvation, and the ultimate authority by which every realm of human knowledge and endeavor should be judged. Therefore, it is to be believed in all that it teaches, obeyed in all that it requires, and trusted in all that it promises.</p>
            <p class="lead">We believe that <span class="gold">God</span> created Adam and Eve in His image, but they sinned when tempted by Satan. In union with Adam, human beings are sinners by nature and by choice, alienated from God, and under His wrath. Only through God’s saving work in Jesus Christ can we be rescued, reconciled and renewed.</p>
            <p class="lead">We believe that <span class="gold">Jesus Christ</span> is <span class="gold">God</span> incarnate, fully <span class="gold">God</span> and fully man, one Person in two natures. <span class="gold">Jesus</span>-Israel’s promised Messiah-was conceived through the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He lived a sinless life, was crucified under Pontius Pilate, arose bodily from the dead, ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of<span class="gold"> God the Father</span> as our High Priest and Advocate. <span class="gold">Jesus Christ</span> shed His blood on the cross as the perfect, all-sufficient sacrifice for our sins.His atoning death and victorious resurrection constitute the only ground for salvation.</p>
            <p class="lead">We believe that the Holy Spirit, in all that He does, glorifies the <span class="gold">Lord Jesus Christ</span>. He convicts the world of its guilt. He regenerates sinners, and in Him they are baptized into union with <span class="gold">Christ</span> and adopted as heirs in the family of <span class="gold">God</span>. He also indwells, illuminates, guides, equips and empowers believers for <span class="gold">Christ</span>-like living and service.</p>
            <p class="lead">We believe in the personal and bodily return of our <span class="gold">Lord Jesus Christ</span>. The coming of <span class="gold">Christ</span>, at a time known only to <span class="gold">God</span>, demands constant expectancy and, as our blessed hope, motivates the believer to godly living, sacrificial service and energetic mission.</p>
            <p class="lead">We believe that <span class="gold">God</span> commands everyone everywhere to believe the gospel by turning to Him in repentance and receiving the <span class="gold">Lord Jesus Christ</span>.</p>
